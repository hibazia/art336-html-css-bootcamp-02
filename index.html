        <h1>Devdas: A Timeless Feature Film</h1>

        <p>Devdas is a 2002 Indian romantic drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and based on the 1917 Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay novella Devdas. This is the third Hindi version and the first film version of the story in Hindi done in colour.[3][4] The film follows Devdas (Shahrukh Khan), a wealthy law graduate, who returns from his studies in London to marry his childhood sweetheart, Paro (Aishwarya Rai).

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The news couldn't have come at a better time. Devdas completes 10 momentous years... It's a very <em>proud</em> and <em>happy</em> moment for me. For a mainstream Hindi film like Devdas to gain such cinematic recognition and be part of such an illustrious list, is an honor not just for me but for the Indian industry at large."</p>
